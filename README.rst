async_gui
---------------

``async_gui`` is a library aimed to make use of threads in GUI applications simpler.
It's inspired by PyCon talk
`Using futures for async GUI programming in Python 3.3 <http://pyvideo.org/video/1762/using-futures-for-async-gui-programming-in-python>`_
and `tornado <https://github.com/facebook/tornado>`_ ``@gen.engine`` implementation.

Most of GUI toolkits don't allow you to access graphical elements from non-GUI thread.
Python 3.2+ has nice new feature ``concurrent.futures``, but we can't just
wait for result from future and callbacks are not very handy.

Combination of `Coroutines via Enhanced Generators (PEP-342) <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/>`_
and ``futures`` creates a rich and easy to use asynchronous programming model
which can be used for creating highly responsive GUI applications.


Example
-------

Demo of button click handler:

.. code-block:: python

    @engine.asynchronous
    def on_button_click(self, *args):
        self.status_label.setText("Downloading image...")
        # Run single task in separate thread
        image_data = yield Task(self.load_url,
                                "http://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo4w.png")
        pixmap = QtGui.QPixmap.fromImage(QtGui.QImage.fromData(image_data))
        self.image_label.setPixmap(pixmap)
        self.status_label.setText("Downloading pages...")
        urls = ['http://www.google.com',
                'http://www.yandex.ru',
                'http://www.python.org']
        # Run multiple task simultaneously in thread pool
        pages = yield [Task(self.load_url, url) for url in urls]
        self.status_label.setText("Done")
        avg_size = sum(map(len, pages)) / len(pages)
        self.result_label.setText("Average page size: %s" % avg_size)


Tasks yielded from ``on_button_click()`` executed in thread pool, but
GUI updates done in the GUI thread.
For CPU-bound applications there is also ability to run tasks in pool of
processes.
